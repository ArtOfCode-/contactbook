<h1>What security technologies are used on this site?</h1>
<p>I take privacy and security seriously, and in developing this site have employed a number of security technologies to
  keep personal data safe.</p>

<h3>Database</h3>
<p>All site data is stored in a database. This is an SQLite database hosted and managed by Amazon Web Services. The
  site interfaces this database through the Ruby on Rails web framework, which is the primary development environment.
  The database is stored securely and requires a secure access key to access any data.</p>

<h3>Account Details</h3>
<p>Signing up for an account on this site requires an email address, a username, and a password. Passwords in particular
  are handled carefully - they are <em>never</em> stored in plain text in the database (and consequently, neither I nor the
  website software have access to your plain text password). Passwords are passed through a cryptographic hash system
  called bcrypt, which consists of mixing your password with a random string of characters, then performing a series of
  operations on it several thousand times to obfuscate the original.</p>

<h3>Contact Details</h3>
<p>Obviously, people's contact details are sensitive stuff that you'd prefer didn't get out if it could possibly be avoided.
  All contact details you submit are encrypted before they're saved - no plain text contact details are ever stored in
  the database. The encryption uses a 256-bit (32-character) key and the Rijndael AES algorithm. The administrators do
  not have access to this key, so they can't see your contacts.</p>
